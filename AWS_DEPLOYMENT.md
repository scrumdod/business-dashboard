## Option 2: AWS S3 + CloudFront (Cost-Effective)

For minimal costs and maximum control.

### Step 1: Create S3 Bucket
```bash
# Upload your built files to S3
aws s3 mb s3://your-dashboard-bucket-name
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-dashboard-bucket-name --delete
```

### Step 2: Configure S3 for Static Hosting
1. Go to S3 Console â†’ Your bucket
2. Properties â†’ Static website hosting â†’ Enable
3. Index document: `index.html`
4. Error document: `index.html` (for React routing)

### Step 3: Set Bucket Policy
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-dashboard-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Create CloudFront Distribution
1. CloudFront Console â†’ Create Distribution
2. Origin Domain: Your S3 bucket website endpoint
3. Viewer Protocol Policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
4. Custom Error Pages: 404 â†’ /index.html (for React routing)

# Upload files
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-unique-dashboard-name --delete

# Configure for static hosting
aws s3 website s3://your-unique-dashboard-name --index-document index.html --error-document index.html
```
