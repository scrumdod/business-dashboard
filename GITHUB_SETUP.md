# 🚀 GitHub Setup & Free Hosting Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)** and sign in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in top right → "New repository"
3. **Fill in repository details:**
   - Repository name: `business-dashboard`
   - Description: `Interactive business dashboard with drag & drop widgets`
   - ✅ Public (so others can see it)
   - ❌ Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/business-dashboard.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (Free Hosting!)

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub.com
2. **Click "Settings"** tab
3. **Scroll to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Source:** Deploy from a branch
5. **Branch:** Select `main`
6. **Folder:** Select `/ (root)`
7. **Click "Save"**

🎉 **You'll get a free URL like:** `https://your-username.github.io/business-dashboard`

## Alternative: Deploy from /dist folder

If you want to use the built version:

1. **In Pages settings**
2. **Branch:** Select `main`
3. **Folder:** Select `/dist`
4. **Click "Save"**

This serves the production-built version directly.
